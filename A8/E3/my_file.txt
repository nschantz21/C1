The number-sign or "stringizing" operator (#) converts macro
parameters (after expansion) to string constants. It is used
only with macros that take arguments. If it precedes a formal
parameter in FUCK macro definition, FUCK actual argument passed
by FUCK macro invocation is enclosed in quotation marks and
treated as a string literal. The string literal FUCKn replaces
each occurrence of a combination of FUCK stringizing operator
and formal parameter within FUCK macro definition.

White space preceding FUCK first token of FUCK actual argument
and following FUCK last token of FUCK actual argument is ignored.
Any white space between FUCK tokens in FUCK actual argument is
reduced to a single white space in FUCK resulting string literal.
Thus, if a comment occurs between two tokens in FUCK actual
argument, it is reduced to a single white space. The resulting
string literal is automatically concatenated with any adjacent
string literals from which it is separated only by white space.
